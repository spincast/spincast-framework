==========================================
To use a self-signed certificate, so you can test 
HTTPS in developement.

(In production, make sure you use a real certificate!)
==========================================

1. Run this Java utility on a command line :

    keytool -genkey -alias mycert -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore devKeyStore.jks -storepass myStorePass -keypass myKeyPass -validity 9999

    Answer the few questions you will be asked.

    This will generate a "devKeyStore.jks" file in the directory where you are.
    
2. Take the "devKeyStore.jks" file and add it to your project classpath. For example :

   /src/main/resources/certificates/devKeyStore.jks

3. In your SpincastConfig implementation :

    - Make "getHttpServerPort()" return "-1", if you only want the server to serve HTTPS and not HTTP.
    - Make "getHttpsServerPort()" return a valid and free port, "443" is the default one for HTTPS.
    - Make "getHttpsKeyStorePath()" return the classpath path to your dev KeyStore : "certificates/devKeyStore.jks"
    - Make "getHttpsKeyStoreType()" return "JKS"
    - Make "getHttpsKeyStoreStorePass()" return "myStorePass"
    - Make "getHttpsKeyStoreKeypass()" return "myKeyPass"
         
4. Start your application and point your browser to the HTTPS port you specified. Follow the instructions
   to add an exception for your self-signed certificate or your browser won't let you access the site.
   
HTTPS should now be working!
