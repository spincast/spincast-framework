    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a> protocol is now officially supported by Spincast.
</p>
<p>
    You can read more about this topic in the dedicated <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#http2">HTTP/2 section</a> of the documentation.

    Spincast supports <code>HTTP/2</code> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push">Server Push</a> in
    two ways:
    <ul>
        <li>
            If your application is standalone and <code>HTTP/2</code> connections are managed by the embedded server 
            (<a href="http://undertow.io/">Undertow</a> is the default).
        </li>
        <li>
            If your application is behind a <code>reverse proxy</code> such as <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a>
            or <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
