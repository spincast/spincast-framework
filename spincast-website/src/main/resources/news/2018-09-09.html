    A new plugin, <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-hotswap">Spincast Hotswap</a>, helps you
    configure <em>hot swapping</em> (sometimes called "<em>hot reloading</em>") in your application. 
</p> 
<p>
    The plugin uses
    <a href="http://hotswapagent.org">HotswapAgent</a> + <a href="https://github.com/dcevm/dcevm">DCEVM</a>
    to get the best Java classes redefinitions solution available for free! 
    The modifications you make to your Java source code during development are immediately picked up, without 
    the need to restart the application.
</p> 
<p>
    In addition to the automatic classes redefinitions provided by HotswapAgent, you can also register <em>listeners</em> 
    to be called when modifications are made. By using such listeners, you can run custom code to react to  modifications
    (by clearing cache, refreshing routes, refreshing configurations, etc.). 
</p> 
<p>
    Those new features lead to a very pleasant and fast development experience.
