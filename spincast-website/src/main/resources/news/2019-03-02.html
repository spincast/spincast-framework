<p>
    A new feature and a new plugin are now available and they work together very well!
</p> 
<p>
    The new feature is <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#hotlinking">Hotlinking Protection</a>.
    This feature allows you to protect resources from your website that may have been embedded in
    a foreign website, without your consent. You can then simply stop serving those hotlinked resources
    (a <em>forbidden</em> status is returned), or you can decide to serve <em>different versions</em>
    of them...
</p> 

<p>
    And this is where the new plugin becomes handy: the <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-watermarker">Spincast Watermark Plugin</a>.
    This plugin allows you to <em>watermark</em> files, images in particular. For example, you could use this plugin to
    create an image identical to a base image but with your logo added at one of its corners.
</p> 

<p>
    Hotlinking protection and watermarking go very well together, as you can now easily serve a watermarked version
    of your images if they are hotlinked without your consent.
