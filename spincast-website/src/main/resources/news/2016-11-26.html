<p>
	This release is <em>huge</em>. We have been working on it for more than 3 months now.
    The last released version of Spincast contained approximately 800 tests, there are now over 1600!
</p>
<p>
    The core of this release is about <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#forms">HTML Forms</a> and
    <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#validation">Validation</a>. There's a lot more than that, but
    those are the two big novelties.

<p>
    Spincast supports <code>Json</code> and <code>XML</code> out of the box since day one, so 
    developing a <code>Single Page Application</code>
    or a set of <code>REST services</code> has always been easy. But, even if <code>SPAs</code> are very popular 
    these days, any serious web framework must provide excellent support for <em>traditional websites</em> too, where the server
    generates the <code>HTML</code> to render. 
</p>
<p> 
    As long as you integrate a good <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#templating_engine">Templating Engine</a>, providing
    HTML generation functionalities is not too hard.
    What's more challenging is to provide a good experience when it's time to deal with <code>forms</code> and
    their validation... And we think we hit the nail on the head! Spincast now provides an easy way to validate
    a submitted form and to redisplay it with <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#validation_messages">Validation Messages</a> 
    resulting from the validation, when this is required.
</p>
<p>
    Another big change in this release is about <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#jsonobject">JsonObjects</a> : they
    are now more powerful than ever and they are used pretty much <em>everywhere</em> in Spincast. We added to them a feature we call
    <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#jsonobject_jsonpaths">JsonPaths</a> : this makes retrieving an element,
    inside an element, inside an array, inside an element, as simple as :
</p>
<p>
    <code>Date myDate = myJsonObject.getDate("<strong><em>user.books[3].publishingDate</em></strong>")</code>.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="inlineIcon" src="{{appUrlPrefix}}/public/images/icons/tipy.png" />
    We also added a small <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#quick_tutorial">Quick Tutorial</a> section which is a
    high-level view of the main steps involved when building an application using Spincast. And, finally, we cleaned a lot 
    of code, which now follows more closely Java's standards (no more <code>"I"</code> prefixed interfaces!).
