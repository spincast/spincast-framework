    A new plugin, <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-flyway-utils">Spincast Flyway Utils</a>, integrates
    <a href="https://flywaydb.org/">Flyway</a> into Spincast to provide easy migrations for your SQL database.  
</p> 
<p>
    By using this plugin, you write your migrations using
    plain Java code, will full dependency injection support. You are also sure the appropriate connection
    will be used when running the SQL queries, even when your code makes use of existing
    components that are not aware of the migration context.
