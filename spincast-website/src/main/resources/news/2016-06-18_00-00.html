<p>
    We are very happy to announce that <code>WebSockets</code> support has been added to Spincast. 
    It took a lot of work but the result is rewarding! This is a huge step toward Spincast 1.0.0.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#websockets">WebSockets section</a> has been added to
            the documentation. 
        </li>
        <li>
            You can try a live <img src="{{appUrlPrefix}}/public/images/demo.png" /> <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/showcase/websockets/echo-all">WebSockets demo</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can find our tests
            <a href="https://github.com/spincast/spincast-framework/tree/master/spincast-core-parent/spincast-core-tests/src/test/java/org/spincast/tests/websocket">here</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Not only does Spincast now supports WebSockets server-side, but 
    we also developed a <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-http-client-with-websocket">new version of our HTTP Client</a>, also
    with WebSockets support. If you need a very easy to use HTTP and WebSocket Java client, look no further! 
    The popular <a href="https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/">Apache HttpClient</a> doesn't support WebSockets yet.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, we cannot release this version without a big "thank you!" to the folks 
    at <a href="http://undertow.io/">Undertow</a>: our WebSockets implementation is based on a lot of code
    from them!
