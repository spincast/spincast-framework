    Spincast is now used to build itself! <img src="{{appUrlPrefix}}/public/images/crazy.png" />
</p>
<p>
    How is this possible? Well, if you don't know yet, a Maven build process contains multiple <i>phases</i>, 
    one of them is <i>compile</i> and this is where Spincast is actually compiled. But there are many other 
    important phases following that one, and this is where the compiled Spincast classes can be used!
</p>
<p>
    In <code>spincast-website</code>'s <a href="https://github.com/spincast/spincast-framework/blob/master/spincast-website/pom.xml">pom.xml</a>, 
    during the <code>prepare-package</code> phase, we declare <code>exec-maven-plugin</code> plugins to dynamically call some Spincast classes. 
    One of those classes is <a href="https://github.com/spincast/spincast-framework/blob/master/spincast-website/src/main/java/org/spincast/website/maven/SpincastMavenPreparePackage.java">SpincastMavenPreparePackage</a>, 
    for example. Since Spincast is already compiled at this point, we can use it! In this particular case, we use Spincast to create a 
    modified version of the <i>Quick Start</i> application, to zip it, and then to add it to the website's "public" folder, where it can be downloaded.
</p>
<p>
    If you look at <code>SpincastMavenPreparePackage</code>'s code, you'll see that in its <code>main(...)</code> method we start a 
    Guice context using the <code>SpincastDefaultGuiceModule</code> Spincast's Guice module, exactly as we could do for a real 
    Spincast application! This allows us to access all the functionalities, all the utilities provided by Spincast. 
    For example, here we use a Spincast utility to zip the <i>Quick Start</i> sources. Note that we don't start a HTTP server though, 
    since we don't need it!
</p>
<p>
    In summary, instead of using a <code>maven-antrun-plugin</code> plugin for example, and having to 
    deal with cumbersome XML logic when some custom steps are required during a build, we simply start a Guice context and we have 
    full access to Spincast.</p><p>We will probably use that little trick in a reusable 
    <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html">Maven Mojo plugin</a> one day, but 
    for build steps that are <i>specific</i> to a project, this approach works very well.
