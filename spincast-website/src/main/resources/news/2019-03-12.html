<p>
   A new plugin, <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-logback-utils">Spincast Logback Utils</a> is now 
   available. This small plugin allows you to easily configure <a href="https://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a>, for logging purposes in your application.
</p>
<p>
   Using plain Java code, you can specify which configuration file Logback should be configured with, for example depending on the
   <em>environment</em> the application runs on! The plugin also allows you to tweak the content of the configuration file, 
   for example by replacing some <em>placeholders</em>.
