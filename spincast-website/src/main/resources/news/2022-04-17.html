   Unfortunately, Spincast hasn't gained a community, so I won't put as much effort into it as I did in the past. 
   But I still want to keep an updated version for my own projects that use it. 
   This version makes Spincast compatible with Java 17 instead of Java 8, and also contains 
   multiple small fixes and improvements.

    Note that the documentation may not have been updated to reflect all the new features. 
    When in doubt, the code is of course the source of Truth.

	One of the big changes coming with Java 17 is the requirements 
	for the <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-hotswap">Spincast Hotswap</a> plugin. 
	The DCEVM library is not available as standard 
	for JDK 17, so the currently suggested method of automatically 
	reloading a Spincast application is to use a <em>JetBrains</em> JDK release, 
	which already contains DCEVM. More information on the plugin page!
