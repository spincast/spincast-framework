title=Spincast presentation + redirection rules
META_END -->

<p>
	We gave the website a small makeover! A cool presentation of Spincast and its features has been added to the 
	<a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/">home page</a>. We also added a new section: <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/demos-tutorials">Demos / Tutorials</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, we implemented <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#redirections">redirection rules</a>.
	You can now easily specify that a route must be redirected to another one. This is useful, 
	for example, when you change the URL of a resource but don't want the existing links to break.
