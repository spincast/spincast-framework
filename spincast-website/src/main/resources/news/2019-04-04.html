<p>
   If, for some reasons, your prefer to use <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">Gson</a> rather
   than <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson</a> as a way of converting Java Objects into JSON and back, this new plugin is for you.
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-gson">Spincast Gson plugin</a> is a complete replacement
   for the default <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-jackson-json">Spincast Jackson Json plugin</a>
   that is provided in the default Spincast artifact.
</p>
<p>
   Some custom serializers and deserializers are provided. Also, the <a href="https://google.github.io/gson/apidocs/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html">GsonBuilder</a>
   is easy to access so you can add your own configurations to help build the final <code>Gson</code> instance.
