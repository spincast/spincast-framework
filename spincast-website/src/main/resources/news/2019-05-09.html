    A few days ago, we released a plugin to minify your <code>CSS</code>. We now release
    <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-js-closurecompiler">Spincast JS Closure Compiler</a>, a plugin made to
    optimize your <code><em>Javascript</em></code>!
</p>
<p>
    As its name implies, this new plugin makes use of the well-supported <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler">Closure Compiler</a> 
    library, from Google.
</p>
<p>
    All official <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Flags-and-Options">flags and options</a> are supported and easy to specify.
