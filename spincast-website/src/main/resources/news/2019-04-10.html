    <a href="https://spring.io">Spring Framework</a> / <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a> is by far 
    the most popular Java framework. If you are looking for a framework with a very large community
    and for which paid support is available, look no further, you will not find anything better! 
    We used Spring <em>a lot</em> before starting Spincast.
</p>
<p>
    The problem we had with Spring, is that we found ourself asking those questions too often:
    <ul>
        <li>
            "<em>How can I modify that default behavior?</em>"
        </li>
        <li>
            "<em>How do I configure this component?</em>"
        </li>
        <li>
            "<em>How can this work since I didn't even configure it?</em>"
        </li>
        <li>
            "<em>What does this annotation actually do? Can I tweak its behavior?</em>"
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>

    Our experience with Spring Framework is that it tends to be a little bit too
    <em>magical</em>, it tends to hide implementation details too much 
    so your application is harder to configure and tweak. In the name of "<em>Defaults that are good enough 80% of the time</em>", 
    Spring sometimes seems to favor <em>simplicity</em> over <em>providing full control</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="inlineIcon" src="{{appUrlPrefix}}/public/images/icons/tipy.png" />
    Any real-world application <em>will</em> be part of that
    20% requiring a lot of manual tweaking, so why not base it on a framework that favors
    flexibility and control from the ground up?
</p>
<p>
    Yes, it is very easy to start a new Spring Boot application using their
    pretty <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Initializr</a>! But as long as you
    have developed at least one real application in your life, you know that this kind of
    simple bootstrapping is smoke and mirrors: you <em>will</em> have to
    modify/change/replace components at some points or another. You <em>will</em>
    have to manually control what is actually happening behind the scene.
</p>
<p>
    Also, Spring relies a lot on annotations: that contributes to the
    "easy to use" aura. But, as <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/about#annotations">we explain here</a>, we are
    not big fans of annotations.
</p>
<p>

    In the other hand, the very first goal of Spincast is to make modifying anything a <em>borderline trivial task</em>. If 
    you find something that is not easily modifiable and should be, it will be considered as <em>a bug</em> and 
    will be fixed. 
</p>
<p>
    Here is how you tweak almost <em>anything</em> in a Spincast application:
    
    <ol class="normal">
        <li>
            You identify the class containing the code you want to tweak and the interfaces this
            class is bound to in the Guice context.
        </li>
        <li>
            You extend this class to override/tweak/add anything you need. There are
            <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/about#private_methods">no private methods</a> so sky is the limit here.
        </li>
        <li>
            In your application's Guice module, you bind your custom implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Done. No magic. No components hard to extend.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    <img class="inlineIcon" src="{{appUrlPrefix}}/public/images/icons/tipy.png" />
    Even Spincast's <em>core components</em> can be modified using those simple steps.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="inlineIcon" src="{{appUrlPrefix}}/public/images/icons/para.png" />
    In other words, we would say that the main difference between Spring and Spincast
    is that Spincast favors long term flexibility and control from the ground up, while Spring
    seems more preoccupied with providing something that is easy to start with.
