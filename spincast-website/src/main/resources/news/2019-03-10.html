   The very first Git commit of Spincast framework was done April 23, 2016, almost three years ago! Since then, Spincast has always stayed in <em>beta</em>... Why is that?
   The answer is that we wanted to stabilize the API as much as possible and we wanted Spincast to be used on real projects before calling it
   <em>ready</em>.
</p> 
<p>
   Since then, a lot of <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins">new plugins</a> have been developed. A
   <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld">RealWorld.io</a> implementation (<a href="https://github.com/spincast/spincast-realworld">here</a>)
   was also created... RealWorld.io is slowly becoming a mandatory <em>rite of passage</em> for any new framework.
</p>
<p>
   <a href="https://www.bigbadaboomcomics.com">Big Bada Boom comics</a> is an example of a real project entirely based on Spincast. 
   Everything, from authentication to security is based on Spincast framework.
</p>
<p>
   At first, we wanted to migrate Spincast to Java 11 before tagging it <code>1.0.0</code>, but sadly we feel the Java ecosystem is still not perfect in regard to
   the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System">JPMS</a>/Jigsaw module system added in Java 9... 
   We encountered <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54993710/the-package-com-google-inject-is-accessible-from-more-than-one-module">many errors</a> 
   using the popular IDEs trying to migrate. So we decided to stabilize on Java 8 first. Spincast <code>2.X.X</code> will be based on Java 11 when we feel
   the tools are mature enough.

   Please play with the <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#quick_start">Quick Start application</a>! Tell us what you think.
   Feel free to <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/community#contribution">contribute</a>. We know we do not have the
   financial resources or a community as big as other frameworks such as <em>Spring</em>, but look at the code, experiment 
   a bit, make your own mind.
