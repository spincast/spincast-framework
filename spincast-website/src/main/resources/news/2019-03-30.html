<p>
   We are happy to announce that Spincast now has a plugin to generate 
   <a href ="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> / <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/">Swagger</a> specifications!
   This allows you to document a <code>REST API</code> developed using Spincast easily.
</p>
<p>
   The plugin, <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-openapi-bottomup">Spincast OpenAPI Bottom Up</a>,
   uses a <em>bottom-up</em> approach (also called "<em>code first</em>" approach) as it starts from the code
   of your application to generate the associated OpenAPI specifications as <code>JSON</code> or as <code>YAML</code>.
</p>

<p>
   This plugin reuses a lot of code from the battle-tested and 
   well-maintained official <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core">Swagger Core</a>
   reference implementation. Doing so, the implementation should respect the
   OpenAPI specifications very well and should also be future-proof.
</p>
