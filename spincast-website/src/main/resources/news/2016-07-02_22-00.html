<p>
    There is a new section in the documentation about <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#testing">testing your application 
    using Spincast</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    Spincast testing is first and foremost about <em>using a Guice context to run the tests</em>. We developed a 
    <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#testing_runner">custom JUnit runner</a> to make this
    process very easy. This allows any dependency you need to be injected into your test classes.
</p>
<p>
    Even cooler (in our opinion!), have a look the <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/documentation#testing_app_example">Integration test example</a>
    to see how Spincast testing utilities can help you run tests <em>on your actual application</em>. 
    No mocks, no simulation. This approach leads to very trustworthy tests since they are run on your real application, 
    and not on a version where many components have been mocked.
