    Have you ever wish you could easily <em>limit the number of attempts</em> a visitor can make at something, on your site?
    For example to limit the number of registrations done using the same IP address, or to limit the number of messages sent by a specific user?
</p>

    The new <a href="{{appUrlPrefix}}/plugins/spincast-attempts-limiter">Spincast Attempts Limiter</a> plugin does exactly that!
    It helps you deal with actions performed too much, or even with <em>brute force attacks</em>, by limiting the attempts a visitor/user can make
    trying to perform a given action.
