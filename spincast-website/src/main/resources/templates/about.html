            Why Spincast?

                    Why Spincast?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We tried a lot of Java web frameworks in the past few years, in addition to the obvious Spring Framework
                    with which we already had a lot of experience. Sadly, there was always a little something we dislike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main issue with most of the frameworks out there, in our opinion, is that they
                    are often too <em>opinionated</em>. We are grown-up developers, and we don't like when a framework
                    tells us how things have to be done. We wanted a flexible framework which 
                    would allow developers to override pretty much everything, even if that means they would also be 
                    able to <em>break</em> everything!
                    We wanted a framework which would feel as much as possible like a <em>library</em>.
                    A framework made to be extensible, from the ground up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created Spincast in an attempt to be that flexible framework we were looking for. 
                    The core ideology will always stay "<em>Power to the developers</em>".
                    In Spincast, everything is configurable, everything can be tweaked.

                What about Spring Framework?
                ==========================================#}

                    What about Spring Framework?
                </h3>

				<p>
				    <a href="https://spring.io">Spring Framework</a> / <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a> is by far 
				    the most popular Java framework. If you are looking for a framework with a very large community
                    and for which paid support is available, look no further, you will not find anything better! 
                    We used Spring <em>a lot</em> before starting Spincast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem we had with Spring, is that we found ourself asking those questions too often:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            "<em>How can I modify that default behavior?</em>"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "<em>How do I configure this component?</em>"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "<em>How can this work since I didn't even configure it?</em>"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "<em>What does this annotation actually do? Can I tweak its behavior?</em>"
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" />
                    Our experience with Spring Framework is that it tends to be a little bit too
                    <em>magical</em>, it tends to hide implementation details too much 
                    so your application is harder to configure and tweak. In the name of "<em>Defaults that are good enough 80% of the time</em>", 
                    Spring sometimes seems to favor <em>simplicity</em> over <em>providing full control</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/tipy.png" />
                    Any real-world application <em>will</em> be part of that
                    20% requiring a lot of manual tweaking, so why not base it on a framework that favors
                    flexibility and control from the ground up?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, it is very easy to start a new Spring Boot application using their
                    pretty <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Initializr</a>! But as long as you
                    have developed at least one real application in your life, you know that this kind of
                    simple bootstrapping is smoke and mirrors: you <em>will</em> have to
                    modify/change/replace components at some points or another. You <em>will</em>
                    have to manually control what is actually happening behind the scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, Spring relies a lot on annotations: that contributes to the
                    "easy to use" aura. But, as <a href="#annotations">we explain here</a>, we are
                    not big fans of annotations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" />
                    In the other hand, the very first goal of Spincast is to make modifying anything a <em>borderline trivial task</em>. If 
                    you find something that is not easily modifiable and should be, it will be considered as <em>a bug</em> and 
                    will be fixed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is how you tweak almost <em>anything</em> in a Spincast application:
                    
                    <ol class="normal">
                        <li>
                            You identify the class containing the code you want to tweak and the interfaces this
                            class is bound to in the Guice context.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You extend this class to override/tweak/add anything you need. There are
                            <a href="#private_methods">no private methods</a> so sky is the limit here.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In your application's Guice module, you bind your custom implementation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Done. No magic. No components hard to extend.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/tipy.png" />
                    Even Spincast's <em>core components</em> can be modified using those simple steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" />
                    In other words, we would say that the main difference between Spring and Spincast
                    is that Spincast favors long term flexibility and control from the ground up, while Spring
                    seems more preoccupied with providing something that is easy to start with.

                    <p>    
                        Java has a lot of haters, these days. On some forums, you almost feel bad to say you're a fan of the language! 
                        But the reality is that there are <em>a lot</em> of happy Java developers out there. 
                        Maybe they are discreet simply because they're just comfortable with their
                        tools and don't care to argue?
                    </p>    
                    <p>    
                        Java is a <em>mature</em> statically typed language; the JVM is freaking performant, and the library 
                        ecosystem is huge! Also, the various IDEs and tools are top notch, they allow a 
                        fantastic coding/refactoring experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Those who say Java is bloated and too complex, are clearly not aware of the modern frameworks 
                        and probably still have in mind the old days of <code>J2EE</code> or the <code>applets</code> disaster. 
                        Java may be somewhat verbose, and that's true in some cases, but that is not a bad thing in our opinion: 
                        verbosity doesn't necessarily mean 
                        "<em>hard to read and understand</em>"... In fact, we find that it is often the opposite! 
                        Very compact one-liners full of lambdas are often way harder to understand than a 
                        couple lines of explicit anonymous classes. And, anyway, Java now has lambdas. Finally, it is your
                        choice if you prefer to call your variables and methods <code>"ulf"</code> and <code>"create()"</code> instead of 
                        <code>"userListFactory"</code> and <code>"createDynamicRouteHandler()"</code>. But we, personally, 
                        don't mind verbosity.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        We have some experience outside Java too: with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> for example. 
                        Being able to use one language
                        everywhere is an attractive idea, but Javascript? <a href="https://twitter.com/weitzelb/status/718623065480019968"><em>Javascript</em></a> ?? 
                        TypeScript is an improvement,
                        but the coding experience, even if better than before, is far from the one provided by
                        the various Java tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        C# and the .NET platform also provide that fantastic coding experience and maturity, but they are too
                        platform centric.

                    <p>    
                        Once you've worked with dependency injection, it's hard to go back. To design a whole application 
                        using DI may be tricky when you are new to it, but the reward is <em>huge</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Being able to easily access the components you need 
                        (by injecting them) and always be sure they are properly initialized? Easy testing? Easy implementation swapping? 
                        Yes, please!
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        <a href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation">Guice</a>  is, in our opinion, the best dependency 
                        injection library of the Java ecosystem. The way the modules
                        work together, and the fact that almost everything is statically typed, is just fantastic. Actually, the fact that Spincast 
                        would be based on Guice from the ground up is probably the very first decision we made.

                ==========================================#}
                <div id="configuration_over_convention">
                    <h4><a class="anchor_small" href="#configuration_over_convention" title="permanent link"></a> <em>Configuration</em> over convention</h4>
                    <p>
                        The opposite, <em>convention over configuration</em>, has its benefits. For example, it is easier to be up and running on
                        a project where conventions have been used. There is only one way of doing things, so any 
                        project is similar to the other. There is also less boilerplate since some magic
                        is used: "<em>That class name ends with "Controller"? Well, it is now a controller!</em>" 
                    </p>    
                     <p>   
                        We're not big fans of that kind of magic. We prefer when things are <em>obvious</em> because they have been
                        explicitly configured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, conventions kind of <em>restricts</em> possibilities. "<em>You want to structure a part of your application this
                        way because it makes more sense? I don't think so, sorry dude!</em>".
                        Again, we're grown-up developers and we want the freedom to ajust what we want, to structure our application
                        as we want.

                    <p>
                        Configuration FTW!

                The choices we made / Plain Java code over annotations

                    <h4><a class="anchor_small" href="#annotations" title="permanent link"></a> Plain Java code over annotations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Annotations are a double-edged sword. They are simple to use and often convenient, but they also
                        tend to <em>hide logic</em> and make things seem to work automagically. This is sometimes fine, but when you 
                        need to understand exactly how things work, or when you need flexibility and control,
                        annotations can be a real pain.
                    </p>    
                    <p> 
                        Annotations are also limited in the way they can be used. They don't support Java code so adding 
                        logic to them is hard : you can't use <code>if / else</code> conditions, you can't
                        call <code>methods</code>, etc. Some people try to get around this limitation by using
                        some kind of expression language, something like <code>@MyAnnotation("${myVar + 42}")</code>... But this is
                        only a hack : there is no type safety and it feels very unnatural in a  Java application.
                    </p>      
                    
                    <p> 
                        Annotations are very good at being <em>flags</em>, or at providing basic information about
                        an element. For example, the <code>@Inject</code> or <code>@Override</code> annotations are
                        perfectly fine : they don't hide anything and serve purely as <em>indications</em>. But some frameworks 
                        have a tendency to use annotations for pretty much <em>everything</em>, and this is something
                        we do not agree with.
                    </p>    

                    <p> 
                        Spincast doesn't use many annotations
                        and will in general favor plain Java code when it's time to configure something. The 
                        <a href="/documentation#forms_validation_intro">form validation</a> we suggest is a good example : 
                        it is purely based
                        on Java code, not on annotations such as <a href="http://hibernate.org/validator/">Hibernate validator</a>.

                The choices we made / Not fans of ORMs
                ==========================================#}
                <div id="orm">
                    <h4><a class="anchor_small" href="#orm" title="permanent link"></a> No ORM</h4>
                    <p>
                        We are definitively not fans of ORMs such as JPA/Hibernate. Our experience is that an ORM 
                        may seem easy to use with a simple CRUD application, but as soon as you deal with a real-world application, 
                        you discover its ugly hidden complexity...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We suggest you carefully read <a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781430219569">Pro JPA 2</a>
                        to get an idea of the details you need to know to deal with JPA properly! It is not trivial. There
                        are <em>a lot</em> of corner cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plain SQL is what we suggest, with the help of <a href="/documentation#jdbc">JDBC utilities</a>. We are not
                        saying plain SQL is always easy, but at least you keep <em>full</em> control over what is going on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those reasons, you will probably never see an official Spincast JPA/Hibernate plugin.
                        The community may create one and we will link to it, but we will not support it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may consider developing official plugins for sane solutions such as <a href="https://www.jooq.org">JOOQ</a> or
                        <a href="http://www.mybatis.org/mybatis-3/">MyBatis</a> at one point, though.

                {#==========================================
                The choices we made / Not asynchronous
                ==========================================#}
                <div id="not_asynchronous">
                    <h4><a class="anchor_small" href="#not_asynchronous" title="permanent link"></a> Not asynchronous</h4>
                    <p>
                        The problem with asynchronous code is that it's a lot harder
                        and trickier to get right. Thinking in an asynchronous manner when coding is not 
                        natural! It is no coincidence that constructs like 
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">promises</a>, 
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*">generators</a> 
                        have been created: they try to make asynchronous coding less painful. The <code>Async/Await</code> pattern is ok,
                        but still hard to get right in some situations.
                    </p>  
                    <p> 
                        Don't get us wrong... We <em>do love</em> asynchronous processing at Spincast! We strongly believe that reactive patterns 
                        using <code>Message brokers</code> / <code>Queuing</code> are very good approaches in many applications. 
                        But the important thing to understand is that the
                        <em>code itself doesn't have to be asynchronous for asynchronous patterns to be implemented</em>! In fact, our opinion is that
                        they are more easy to implement using a synchronous code base.
                    </p> 
                    <p> 
                        So Spincast is synchronous, and this is clearly a conscious decision. You may say this is one of the 
                        points where Spincast is not "flexible" and will probably never be.
                    </p> 
                </div>
                
                {#==========================================
                The choices we made / Private methods
                ==========================================#}
                <div id="private_methods">
                    <h4><a class="anchor_small" href="#private_methods" title="permanent link"></a> No private methods</h4>
   
                    <p>
                        There may be some exceptions, but there are practically no <code>private</code> methods in Spincast's core and 
                        plugins: the default visibility for methods is <code>protected</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        But... Isn't this a bad practice?  Shouldn't you hide your implementation details?
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                         Well, it depends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we previously said, we're not fans of libraries/frameworks which are too opinionated or that use
                        static components that can't be extended. Developers should
                        always have <em>full</em> control over what's going on! And the "<em>no private methods</em>" decision 
                        follows that principle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More than one time we have encountered a library, or part of a framework, which was doing exactly
                        what we needed <em>except a little something</em>! In those cases, the solution is often
                        to extend the class containing the problematic code and to override a particular
                        method. But many libraries/frameworks make this very difficult by using <code>private</code>
                        visibility for lots of their methods. Yes, we get it: they hide their implementation details!
                        But, doing so, they prevent you from adjusting what you would need. So what do you do then? You hope for a code change 
                        from the authors, or you simply stop using that library...
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Of course, many libraries try to help you by providing <em>some</em> <code>protected</code> methods, but
                        the choices they made is not always the ones you need!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, our mantra, once again: "<em>Flexibility / Power to the developers</em>"! In Spincast, there are no <code>private</code> 
                        methods, at all. If you override a Spincast method because you have to, it is <em>your</em> responsibility as a developer
                        to adjust your code if the base code changes. But, at least, <em>you can do it</em>.
