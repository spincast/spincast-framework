            Introduction
        </h4>
        <p>
            Spincast is based on the shoulders of a giant, <a href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation">Guice</a>
            (from Google).
            Other Java web frameworks may claim they <em>support</em> Guice, and maybe even have a
            section of their documentation dedicated to the topic. Spincast is one of those that is <em>totally</em> built on
            Guice, from the ground up! If you already know Guice, Spincast will be really easy to grasp for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Guice is not only (in our opinion) the best dependency injection library of the Java ecosystem, but also a
            fantastic base to build modular applications. Everything is divided into <code>modules</code> which
            are swappable and overridable. Each module can declare which dependencies it requires from other
            modules. In fact, Guice is so flexible that you may even find ways of using Spincast we haven't think about!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you know another dependency injection library, like <a href="https://spring.io">Spring</a>, it can also help but 
            you'll probably have to learn one of two new tricks!
        </p>

                Here's what using Spincast looks like at a very high level:

            <p class="center">
                <img src="/public/images/arch/spincast_high_level.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
                Users make requests to your web application. This application can
                have an <code>HTML</code> interface, built using popular tools like
                <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react">React</a>,
                <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org">Angular</a>, etc. That
                <code>HTML</code> interface can be generated by Spincast (using a built-in <a href="#templating_engine">templating engine</a>) or
                can be a <code>Single Page Application</code> where Spincast is used as a bootstrapper and a
                data provider (<code>JSON</code> or <code>XML</code>) for the SPA.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" /> 
                Spincast is also a good platform to build <code>REST</code> web services or microservices,
                without any user interface, since it "talks" <code>JSON</code> and <code>XML</code> natively.

            Architecture
        </h4>
        <p>
            The core of a Spincast application is its <code>Guice modules</code>. Most of the time, your
            application's main Guice module will extend the default <code>SpincastDefaultGuiceModule</code>,
            so you start with a default implementation for all the required components, and not from scratch. Many
            components are provided by the various <a href="/plugins">Plugins</a>,
            but your application will also bind components specific to it business logic : 
            <code>controllers</code>, <code>services</code>, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="center tallBottom">
            <img src="/public/images/arch/code_structure.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see : 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Spincast's top Guice module is <code>SpincastCoreGuiceModule</code>. This core module is provided 
                    by the <code>spincast-core</code> Maven artifact. It binds a couple of components (mostly the <code>Front Controller</code>),
                    but its main job is to validate that implementations for all the required components have been bound by
                    the other modules. A Spincast application is made of multiple Guice modules and each of them can validate
                    that some required bindings have been done by other modules, or else they can throw an exception.
                    <br />
                    The interfaces for the required components are also bundled in the <code>spincast-core</code> Maven artifact.
                </li>
                <li>
                     The other big part of Spincast is the various <a href="/plugins">Plugins</a>. Plugins can provide an 
                     implementation for a required component, but can also provide extra components to add functionalities. 
                     Most of the time, a Plugin has its own Guice module which you have to install to activate the Plugin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>SpincastDefaultGuiceModule</code> is a Guice module provided by the <code>spincast-default</code> Maven artifact.
                    Its only job is to install some plugins so a default implementation is provided for all the <a href="#required_components">required components</a>.
                    Except if you really need <em>full</em> control over all the implementations which are actually bound, you 
                    would probably start with that default Guice module instead of the <code>core</code> one. Doing so, you can
                    still tweak/override the bindings, but at least you do not start from scratch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, you have your application's own Guice module (named  <code><em>AppGuiceModule</em></code> in the previous
                    image). In this module,
                    you can override some default bindings. The best example of this would be to override the implementation
                    of the <code>SpincastConfig</code> component so you can change the <em>port</em> the server will be running on.
                    Of course, in this module, you're also going to bind your application specific components: the controllers, 
                    the services, etc. Since all this is standard Guice development, make sure you read 
                    <a href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/GettingStarted">Guice documentation</a> if you have questions about the modules,
                    the bindings and the injection of dependencies!

            Request handling
        </h4>
        <p>
            Now that we have an idea on how is structured a Spincast application, let's see how it handles requests
            and what are the components involved.
        </p>
        <div class="archZoom">
        
            <p class="center tallBottom">
                <img src="/public/images/arch/request_handling.png" />
            </p>

            <p>
                <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" />
                First, the embedded HTTP <code>Server</code> receives a request from a user. This server consists 
                of a <a class="javadoc" href="/public/javadoc/org/spincast/core/server/Server.html"><code>Server</code></a> interface and an
                implementation. The default implementation is provided by 
                the <a href="/plugins/spincast-undertow"><code>spincast-plugins-undertow</code></a>
                plugin which uses the <a href="http://undertow.io">Undertow</a> HTTP/Websocket server.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the request is for a  <a href="#static_resources">static resource</a>, the server serves it directly without even reaching the
                framework. Note that it's also possible to generate the resource, using a standard route, so the request <em>does</em>
                enter the framework. There is even a third option which is what we call 
                <a href="#dynamic_resources">dynamic resources</a>:
                if a request is made for a request which currently doesn't exist, the server will pass the request to the framework, the
                framework can then create the resource and return it... The following requests for the same resource will use
                the generated resource and won't reach the framework anymore!
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" />
                If the request is not for a static resource, the server passes it to the first 
                Spincast component involved : the <code>Front Controller</code>. The <code>Front Controller</code> is at the very center
                of Spincast! This is one of the very few components which is <em>not</em> provided by a Plugin, but
                that is actually included in the <code>spincast-core</code> Maven artifact itself. Note that you still <em>can</em> extend the default
                <code>Front Controller</code> and override some of its methods, though, if you need to tweak one thing or two. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The job of the <code>Front Controller</code> is to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ask the <code>Router</code> for the appropriate route to use when a request arrives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Call the <code>Route Handlers</code> of the matching route. A route can have many handlers :
                        they are <a href="#filters">Filters</a> which are run <em>before</em> the <code>Main Handler</code>, the <code>Main Handler</code>
                        itself, and some <a href="#filters">Filters</a> which are run <em>after</em> the <code>Main Handler</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the request is for a <code>WebSocket</code> connection, the handling of the request 
                        is made by a <a href="#websockets_controllers"><code>WebSocket Controller</code></a> instead of a <code>Route Handler</code>.
                        Also, the result is not a simple response but a permanent and full duplex connection where each side 
                        can send messages to the other side.
                        Have a look at the <a href="#websockets">WebSockets</a> section for more information!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If no matching route is returned by the <code>Router</code>, the <code>Front Controller</code> 
                        will use a <code>Not Found route</code>. The <code>Not Found route</code> can be a custom
                        one, or the default one provided by Spincast.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If any exception occures during any of those steps, the <code>Front Controller</code> 
                        will use an <code>Exception route</code>. The <code>Exception route</code> can be a custom
                        one, or the default one provided by Spincast.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" />
                The job of the <a class="javadoc" href="/public/javadoc/org/spincast/core/routing/Router.html"><code>Router</code></a> is to determine the appropriate 
                route to use, given the URL of the request, its <code>HTTP method</code>, etc. It will also
                extract the value of the dynamic path tokens, if any. For example, a route path could be
                <code>"/user/${userId}/tasks"</code>. If a <code>"/user/42/tasks"</code> request is made, the router will
                extract "<em>42</em>" as the value of the <code>userId</code> parameter and make this available to the rest of the
                framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" />
                Finally:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <code>Route Handlers</code> receive a <code>Request Context</code> (which represents the request),
                        and decide what to return as the response. This can be anything: <code>Json</code>, <code>HTML</code>,
                        <code>XML</code> or even <code>bytes</code>.
                        <br />
                        <span class="underline">or:</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A <code>WebSocket Controller</code> receives the request for a WebSocket connection, allows or
                        denies it, and then receives and sends messages on that connection.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <p>
            The <em>required components</em> are those without which a Spincast application can't even run. 
            Any class, any <code>Plugin</code>, can assume those components are available, so they can 
            inject them and use them!
        </p>    
        <p>
            It is Spincast's core module, <code>SpincastCoreGuiceModule</code>,
            which validates that an implementation for those components is actually bound. If something is missing,
            an exception is thrown and the appliation is not started.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Default implementations for those required components are bound by the <code>SpincastDefaultGuiceModule</code> 
            Guice module, which is provided by the <code>spincast-default</code> Maven artifact. Using the
            <code>SpincastDefaultGuiceModule</code> Guice module as a base is the easiest way to develop a Spincast

            Transitive dependencies
        </h4>
        <p>
            The <code>spincast-core</code> Maven artifact only has 3 direct dependencies which are external to Spincast:
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>com.google.inject:*</strong> (Guice), which pulls three transitive dependencies :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>com.google.guava:guava-parent</strong> (Guava)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>javax.inject:javax.inject</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>aopalliance:aopalliance</strong>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305</strong> : For the <code>@Nullable</code> annotation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>org.slf4j:slf4j-api</strong> : The <code>SLF4J</code> logging facade.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>   
        <p> 
            The versions used for those dependencies are defined in the <code>spincast-parent</code>
            Maven artifact's <code>pom.xml</code>.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            Spincast core also uses some <a href="https://commons.apache.org/">Apache commons</a> libraries,
            but those are <em>shaded</em>, their classes have been relocated under Spincast's 
            <code><em>org.spincast.shaded</em></code> package, so they won't conflit with your own dependencies.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            <img class="inlineIcon" src="/public/images/icons/para.png" />
            That said, each <a href="/plugins">Plugin</a> also adds its own dependencies! If you start with
            the <code>spincast-default</code> Maven artifact, a bunch of transitive dependencies
            will be included. If you need full control over the transitives dependencies added to
            your application, start with the <code>spincast-core</code> Maven artifact and pick, one by one, the
            plugins and implementations you want to use.
